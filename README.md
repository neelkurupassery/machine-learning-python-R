# machine-learning-python-R

Three main data sources without direct access to data: 
1) Simulated Data Sets (allow for valuable testing of algorithms and robustness over various dimensional spaces / effect of increasing noise / effect of assumptions on results)

2) Open source data sets (have to consider any obfuscation)

3) Clinical Trials Gov datasets (10 GB of XMLs)
I've converted these to JSON to more easily probe and perform machine learning tests / NLP.
